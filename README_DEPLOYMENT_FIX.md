# ðŸš¨ Render Deployment Fix

## The Problem

You're deploying the entire monorepo to Render, but Render is trying to serve static files instead of running your backend API server. This is because:

1. You're deploying the entire repository instead of just the backend
2. Render is looking for static files in `/opt/render/project/src/backend/src/dist/index.html`

## The Solution

### Option 1: Deploy Backend Only to Render (Recommended)

1. **Create a new Render service** for just the backend:
   - Go to [render.com](https://render.com) â†’ New â†’ Web Service
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - **Important**: Set the **Root Directory** to `backend/`
   - Configure as follows:

```
Name: alfred-ai-backend
Environment: Node
Root Directory: backend/
Build Command: npm install
Start Command: npm run start:production
```

2. **Environment Variables**:
```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=10000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/studentbuddy
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend.vercel.app
```

### Option 2: Use render.yaml (Alternative)

If you want to use the render.yaml file:

1. In Render dashboard, create a **Blueprint** service instead of a Web Service
2. Connect your repository
3. Render will automatically detect and deploy using render.yaml
4. This will create separate services for backend and frontend

## Current Status

âœ… **Backend**: Ready for deployment (MongoDB Atlas + API server)
âœ… **Frontend**: Ready for Vercel deployment
âœ… **Configuration**: All files properly configured

## Quick Fix Steps

1. **Deploy Backend to Render**:
   - New Web Service
   - Root Directory: `backend/`
   - Environment: Node
   - Start Command: `npm run start:production`

2. **Deploy Frontend to Vercel**:
   - Import repository
   - Root Directory: `frontend/`
   - Set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to your Render backend URL

3. **Update CORS** (after both are deployed):
   - In Render backend settings, update `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` with your Vercel URL

## Why This Happened

The render.yaml file is configured for multi-service deployment, but when you deploy the entire repository as a single service, Render gets confused about what to serve. The backend should be deployed as a separate Node.js service, not as part of the monorepo.

## Result

After following these steps, you'll have:
- **Backend API**: `https://your-backend.onrender.com` (Node.js server)
- **Frontend**: `https://your-frontend.vercel.app` (Static site)

The frontend will communicate with the backend API seamlessly! ðŸŽ‰
